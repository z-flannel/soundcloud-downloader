tested on **scdl v2.12.4.** (required package, newer versions may work with it but i do not guarantee it)

i tried but i cannot currently add full discography uploads as soundcloud doesnt wanna spew out whole a track list with files every time u ask it

if i end up updating this script itll only be for multithreading theres no need to proxy as soundcloud isnt very strict.
